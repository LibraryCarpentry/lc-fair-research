## What does it mean to be machine readable vs human readable?

According to the [Open Data Handbook](http://opendatahandbook.org/glossary/en/):

*Human Readable*
"Data in a format that can be conveniently read by a human. Some human-readable formats, such as PDF, are not machine-readable as they are not structured data, i.e. the representation of the data on disk does not represent the actual relationships present in the data."

*Machine Readable*
"Data in a data format that can be automatically read and processed by a computer, such as CSV, JSON, XML, etc. Machine-readable data must be structured data. Compare human-readable.

Non-digital material (for example printed or hand-written documents) is by its non-digital nature not machine-readable. But even digital material need not be machine-readable. For example, consider a PDF document containing tables of data. These are definitely digital but are not machine-readable because a computer would struggle to access the tabular information - even though they are very human readable. The equivalent tables in a format such as a spreadsheet would be machine readable.

As another example scans (photographs) of text are not machine-readable (but are human readable!) but the equivalent text in a format such as a simple ASCII text file can machine readable and processable."


## File naming best practices
Stanford Libraries [guidance on file naming](https://library.stanford.edu/research/data-management-services/data-best-practices/best-practices-file-naming) is a great place to start, but general best practice is to organize files in a consistent manner and clearly describe the content they contain. Avoid including spaces and special characters which can be difficult for computers to read. Use common [special letter case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Special_case_styles) patterns such as Kebab-case, CamelCase, or Snake_case. Include author name, project name, type of data, type of analysis, date, and file extension. 
Here are some examples [from Dryad](http://datadryad.com/pages/reusabilityBestPractices):

- 1900-2000_sasquatch_migration_coordinates.csv
- Smith-fMRI-neural-response-to-cupcakes-vs-vegetables.nii.gz
- 2015-SimulationOfTropicalFrogEvolution.R

## Directory structures and README files
For others to reuse your research, it is important to include a README file and to organize your files in a logical way. Consider the following file structure examples from Dryad:

![Dryad File Structures](../fig/file_structures.png)

It is also good practice to include README files to describe how the data was collected, processed, and analyzed. In other words, README files help others correctly interpret and reanalyze your data. A README file can include file names/directory structure, glossary/definitions of acronyms/terms, description of the parameters/variables and units of measurement, report precision/accuracy/uncertainty in measurements, standards/calibrations used, environment/experimental conditions, quality assurance/quality control applied, known problems, research date information, description of relationships/dependencies, additional resources/references, methods/software/data used, example records, and other supplemental information.

Different Format Types 
https://data.library.virginia.edu/data-management/plan/format-types/

## Disciplinary Data Formats

Many disciplines have developed formal metadata standards that enable re-use of data; however, these standards are not universal and often it requires background knowledge to indentify, contextualize, and interpret the underlying data. Interoperability between disciplines is still a challenge based on the continued use of custom metadata schmes, and the development of new, incompatiable standards. Thankfully, DataCite is providing a common, overarching metadata standard across disciplinary datasets, albeit at a generic vs granular level. 

In the meantime, the Research Data Alliance (RDA) Metadata Standards Directory - Working Group developed a collaborative, open directory of metadata standards, applicable to scientific data, to help the research community learn about metadata standards, controlled vocabularies, and the underlying elements across the different disciplines, to potentially help with mapping data elements from different sources.
