> ## For data & software to be findable:
> F1. (meta)data are assigned a globally unique and eternally persistent identifier or PID
> F2. data are described with rich metadata
> F3. (meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource
> F4. metadata specify the data identifier  
{: .checklist}

Your institution’s/repository’s role:  
- Assign a globally unique PID upon publication (or draft upload) 
- Provide metadata schema in human- & machine-readable format (PID, author names, subject areas, etc)
- Support structured input of metadata (submission forms or XML schema)
- Index (meta)data to enable effective searching
- Allow metadata upload & assign corresponding PID

Your role as a researcher:  
- Check datasets that you use for PIDs & cite them
- Ensure that your datasets get published with PIDs
- Choose repositories that automate PID registration
- Report this requirement to repositories that don’t assign PIDs
- Add rich metadata (describe the dataset’s context, quality, condition & characteristics)
- Should be understandable by researchers from different disciplines (ask a friend to proofread)

## PIDs in the wild

To start, we can have a look at the following paper which includes a note regarding the availability of the supporting data and link (in the form of a digital object identifier or DOI) to the reference:  

include img of paper screenshot...  

Paper:  
Koen Kole, Rik G.H. Lindeboom, Marijke P.A. Baltissen, Pascal W.T.C. Jansen, Michiel Vermeulen, Paul Tiesinga, Tansu Celikel (2017):
Proteomic landscape of the primary somatosensory cortex upon sensory deprivation, GigaScience, Volume 6, Issue 10, 1 October 2017, Pages 1–10. DOI https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/gix082

Quiz  
Do you see the note?  
Can you think about other aspects of the paper that can benefit from PIDs?  


Note in the paper:
“Availability of the supporting data
Data supporting this work are available in the GigaScience repository, GigaDB [14]. The raw mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited in the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository [15] with the dataset identifier PXD005971”

## Anatomy of a PID  
Digital object identifiers or DOIs are a common PID that used in the scholarly ecosystem. DataCite and CrossRef are notable non-profit organizations that operate DOI minting registries.

## Connecting research outputs
DOIs are everywhere. Examples.

## Choosing the right repository

Ask your colleagues & collaborators
Look for institutional repository at your own institution

## Data Journals

Another method available to researchers to cite and give credit to research data is to author works in data journals or supplemental approaches used by publishers, societies, disciplines, and/or journals. 

Articles in data journals allow authors to:
Describe their research data (including information about process, qualities, etc)
Explain how the data can be reused
Improve discoverability (through citation/linking mechanisms and indexing)
Provide information on data deposit
Allow for further (peer) review and quality assurance
Offer the opportunity for further recognition and awards

Examples
Nature Scientific data 
Biomedical Data Journal (BMDJ)
Can you find another example not listed here (e.g. in a discipline)?
