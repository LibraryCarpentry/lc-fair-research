> ## For data & software to be accessible:
> A1.  (meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardized communications protocol  
>     A1.1 the protocol is open, free, and universally implementable  
>     A1.2 the protocol allows for an authentication and authorization procedure, where necessary  
> A2. metadata remain accessible, even when the data are no longer available

## What is a protocol?
Simply put, it's an access method of exchanging data over a computer network.  Each protocol has its rules for how data is formatted, compressed, checked for errors. Research repositories often use the OAI-PMH or REST API protocols to interface with data in the repository. The following image from [TutorialEdge.net: What is a RESTful API by Elliot Forbes](https://tutorialedge.net/general/what-is-a-rest-api/) provides a useful overview of how RESTful interfaces work:

Zenodo offers a visual interface for seeing how formats such as DataCite XML will look like when requested for records such as the following record from the Biodiversity Literature Repository:  

[Formiche di Madagascar raccolte dal Sig. A. Mocquerys nei pressi della Baia di Antongil (1897-1898).](https://sandbox.zenodo.org/record/9785/export/dcite4#.W3eDVthKjGI)

Wikipedia has a list of [commonly used network protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_network_protocols) but check the service you are using for documentation on the protocols it uses. For instance, see [Zenodo's Principles](http://about.zenodo.org/principles/) page.
