## What is a protocol?
Simply put, it's an access method of exchanging data over a computer network.  Each protocol has its rules for how data is formatted, compressed, checked for errors.  

HTTPS, SSH, FTP, ZIP, these are all protocols that you are likely familiar with. Research repositories often use OAI-PMH or REST APIs to interface with data in the repository.
