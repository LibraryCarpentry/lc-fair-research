Data Journals

Another method available to researchers to cite and give credit to research data is to author works in data journals or supplemental approaches used by publishers, societies, disciplines, and/or journals. 

Articles in data journals allow authors to:
Describe their research data (including information about process, qualities, etc)
Explain how the data can be reused
Improve discoverability (through citation/linking mechanisms and indexing)
Provide information on data deposit
Allow for further (peer) review and quality assurance
Offer the opportunity for further recognition and awards

Examples
Nature Scientific data 
Biomedical Data Journal (BMDJ)
Can you find another example not listed here (e.g. in a discipline)?
