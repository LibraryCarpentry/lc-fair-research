## Goals of this lesson:

- To teach FAIRer research data and software management and development practices
- Focus on practical approaches to being FAIRer admitting that there are no “silver bullets”

## What is FAIR?

In 2016, the [FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) were published in Scientific Data. In the paper, the authors provide general guidance on machine-actionability and improvements that can be made to streamline findability, accessibility, interoperatbility, and reuability (or FAIR) of digital assets. Research is increasingly dependent on computational support and yet there are still many bottlenecks in the process. The overall aim of FAIR is to cut down on the inefficient processes in research by taking advantage of linked resources and the exchange of data so that all stakeholders in the research ecosystem, , can automate repetitive, boring, error-prone tasks.

## FAIR, FAIRer, FAIRest

In 2017, 2nd paper:
FAIR: not a standard
Different approaches
About data FAIRness for machines (and humans): 
Partly FAIR may be FAIR enough

## Library services across the research lifecycle

Libraries actively help researchers navigate the requirements, demands, and tools that make up the research data management landscape, particularly when it comes to the organization, preservation, and sharing of research data and software. They play a vital role in directly supporting the academic enterprise by promoting data sharing and reproducibility. Through their research training and services, particularly for early career researchers and graduate students, libraries are driving a cultural shift towards effective data and software stewardship. As a trusted partner, and with an embedded understanding of their communities, libraries foster collaboration and facilitate coordination between community stakeholders and are a critical part of the discussion.

## Good data stewardship starts early

Ultimately, the FAIR principles will lead to more rigorous management and stewardship of digital assets. Stakeholders from across the research lifcycle can apply the principles at different points to the benefit of the greater community. FAIR should also be considered from the very beginning of a research project, and by applying the principles early in the process, the benefits can be further realized and create a virtuous cycle. 


From the start, there are a number of requirements and conditions that should be addressed:

- Funding agency requirements
- Trustworthy research data repositories
- Agency and instutitional data policies
- Standards for data citation, metadata, licensing
- Privacy, intellectual property rights, and copyright
- Methods and tools adapted to the scientific workflows
- Cost recovery strategies
- Motivation for FAIR approach

Barriers and strategies 

Barrier: Most research data is not accessible
Strategy: Incentivise data sharing and publication  

Barrier: Standardized metadata or documentation are not available
Strategy: Mandatory metadata required for persistent identifier registration  

Barrier: No consistent practice of citing and referencing data
Strategy: Providing citation standard DataCite Metadata Schema 4.1  

Barrier: Researchers are unwilling or unable to share data 
Strategy: Inform researchers about benefits and possibilities
