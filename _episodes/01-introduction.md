## Library services across the research lifecycle

Libraries actively help researchers navigate the requirements, demands, and tools that make up the research data management landscape, particularly when it comes to the organization, preservation, and sharing of research data and software. They play a vital role in directly supporting the academic enterprise by promoting data sharing and reproducibility. Through their research training and services, particularly for early career researchers and graduate students, libraries are driving a cultural shift towards effective data and software stewardship. As a trusted partner, and with an embedded understanding of their communities, libraries foster collaboration and facilitate coordination between community stakeholders and are a critical part of the discussion. 

Funding agencies, through data management plan (DMP) requirements, and publishers, through publishing systems, are other stakeholders recognizing and acting on parts of the research life cycle.

## Share and preserve research data  

Before sharing research data, there are a number of requirements and conditions that should be addressed:

- Funding agency requirements
- Trustworthy research data repositories
- Data policies
- Standards for data citation, metadata, licensing
- Privacy, intellectual property rights, copyright, and proprietary data
- Methods and tools adapted to the scientific workflows
- Cost recovery strategies
- Motivation for change

Barriers and strategies 

Barrier: Most research data is not accessible
Strategy: Incentivise data sharing and publication  

Barrier: Standardized metadata or documentation are not available
Strategy: Mandatory metadata required for persistent identifier registration  

Barrier: No consistent practice of citing and referencing data
Strategy: Providing citation standard DataCite Metadata Schema 4.1  

Barrier: Researchers are unwilling or unable to share data 
Strategy: Inform researchers about benefits and possibilities
