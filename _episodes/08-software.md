# Applying FAIR to software

The FAIR principles were developed with research data in mind, however they are relevant for research software as well. The discussion around FAIRification of software is recent and ongoing, particularly with respect to the distinctions between data and software. These determine the extent to which the principles can be adapted, reinterpreted, or expanded.

## Lesson objectives

The objective of this lesson is to get learners up to speed on accepted best practices in FAIR software, and make them aware about the points of debate. 

## Resources

As starting points, we have the following resources: 
- a position paper: https://content.iospress.com/articles/data-science/ds190026
- a FAIR Software guide, with 5 recommendations: https://fair-software.nl/
