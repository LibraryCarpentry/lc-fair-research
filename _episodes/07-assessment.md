## Reasons for assessment

FAIR is a journey. Technology and the way people work is shifting often and what might be FAIR today might not be months, years from now. A FAIR assessment now is a snapshot in time. Nevertheless, individuals, organizations, disciplines, services, countries, and communities will look to how FAIR they are. The reasons are various, including gaining a better understanding, comparing with others, making improvements, and participating further in the scholarly ecosystem, to name a handful. Ultimately, an assessment can be a helpful guide on the path to becoming more FAIR.

> ## Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the FAIRest one of all? 
> [Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the FAIRest one of all?](https://forschungsdaten-thueringen.de/entry/mirror-mirror-on-the-wall-tkfdm-announces-fairest-dataset-award.html) - In March 2020, Theuringen FDM-TAGE offered awards to the FAIRest datasets based on the FAIR principles. The [FAIRest Dataset winners were announced](https://forschungsdaten-thueringen.de/entry/and-the-winner-is.html) in June 2020. What is FAIR about the winning datasets? Is there anything else that can be done to make them FAIRer?

## FAIR is a vision, NOT a standard

The FAIR principles are a way of reaching for best data and software practices, coming to a convergence on what those are, and how to get there. They are NOT rules. They are NOT a standard. They are NOT a requirement. The principles were not meant to be prescriptive but instead offer a vision to optimise data/software sharing and reuse by humans and machines. 

> ## Inconsistent interpretations
> The lack of information on how to implement the FAIR principles have led to inconsistent interpretations of them... Jacobsen, A., de Miranda Azevedo, R., Juty, N., Batista, D., Coles, S., Cornet, R., ... & Goble, C. (2020). [FAIR principles: interpretations and implementation considerations](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/full/10.1162/dint_r_00024).

## Types of assessment

Depending on your needs, whether you want to assess yourself, organizing, community...  the following FAIR assessment tools and exercises are available:

## Individual assessment

How FAIR are you? The FAIRsFAIR project has developed an assessment tool called [FAIR-Aware](https://fairaware.dans.knaw.nl) that both helps you understand the principles and also how you can improve the FAIRness of your research. Before taking the assessment, have a target dataset/software in mind to prepare you for the questions which include questions about yourself and 10 questions about FAIR. Each question provides additional information and guidance and helps you assess your current FAIRness level along with potential actions to take. The assessment takes 10 to 30 minutes to complete depending on your familiarity with the subject and issues covered.

> ## Challenge
> Encourage your workshop participants to review the episodes in this FAIR lesson and take the [FAIR-Aware](https://fairaware.dans.knaw.nl) assessment ahead of time. In person (or virtual), ask the participants to split up into groups and to highlight some of their key questions/findings from the FAIR-Aware assessment. Ask them to note their questions/findings/anything else in the session’s collaborative notes. After a duration, ask the groups to return to the main group and call on each group (leader) to summarise their discussion. Synthesise some of the key points and discuss next steps on how participants can address their FAIRness moving forward.

What to assess
A large subset of the FAIR principles apply to metadata and data
Many reports and projects are investigating how to apply the FAIR principles to digital objects in general, including software and code but also research publications. (https://wellcome.ac.uk/what-we-do/our-work/open-research and https://rd-alliance.org/groups/fair-4-research-software-fair4rs-wg)

## Organization
As an org…

## Discipline/community (journals?)

## National

Exercise - Try and find policies in your region, country, commonwealth that reference the FAIR principles and encourage their implementation

## Services

As a service provider, for example a data repository, you might want to assess the FAIRness of datasets in your systems. You can do this manually by choosing a checklist from the overview provided at https://fairassist.org/#!/

Some infrastructure providers also provide overviews how the service they offer can enable FAIR data. Frameworks and tools to assess services are currently under development.

Zenodo offers an overview of how using zenodo can help data being FAIR: https://about.zenodo.org/principles/ 
Figshare also published a statement paper on how it supports the FAIR principles.
Splawa-Neyman, Patrick (2018): Figshare and the FAIR data principles. figshare. Journal contribution. https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.7476428.v1 

Exercise - Choose a service and think about how it supports the FAIR principles. 

## Other assessment tools
