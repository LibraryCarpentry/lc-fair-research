## Reasons for assessment

FAIR is a journey. Technology and the way people work is shifting often and what might be FAIR today might not be months, years from now. A FAIR assessment now is a snapshot in time. Nevertheless, individuals, organizations, disciplines, services, countries, and communities will look to how FAIR they are. The reasons are various, including gaining a better understanding, comparing with others, making improvements, and participating further in the scholarly ecosystem, to name a handful. Ultimately, an assessment can be a helpful guide on the path to becoming more FAIR.

> [Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the FAIRest one of all?](https://forschungsdaten-thueringen.de/entry/mirror-mirror-on-the-wall-tkfdm-announces-fairest-dataset-award.html) - In March 2020, Theuringen FDM-TAGE offered awards to the FAIRest datasets based on the FAIR principles. The [FAIRest Dataset winners were announced](https://forschungsdaten-thueringen.de/entry/and-the-winner-is.html) in June 2020. What is FAIR about the winning datasets? Is there anything else that can be done to make them FAIRer?

## FAIR is a vision, NOT a standard

The FAIR principles are a way of reaching for best data and software practices, coming to a convergence on what those are, and how to get there. They are NOT rules. They are NOT a standard. They are NOT a requirement. The principles were not meant to be prescriptive but instead offer a vision to optimise data/software sharing and reuse by humans and machines.
